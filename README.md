## ⚡ Enlightening Questions
<!-- 
### ❓ How many Searches can I make?

You get **200 searches free every month**. Each search can get you 1000s of results.

This is enough for most use cases such as getting data for your research project, or finding customers for your startup.

If you need more searches, you can upgrade to the Pro Version. -->

### ❓ How to Get Results for My Queries?

1. Enter your search queries.

![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

2. Now, simply press the Run button.

![Run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/run.png)

3. Get the results in about 2 minutes.

![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)


### ❓ What are the different pages and how do they help me?

Mainly, there are 3 pages in the UI Dashboard:

- Home Page ('/')
- Output Page ('/output')
- Results Page ('/output/1')

#### Home Page ('/')

![Homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/homepage.png)

You can input your queries here and search by:
- List of queries
![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

- List of links
![links-queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/links-queries.png)

- Scrape data for a specific type of business across all cities in a country.
![country-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/country-section.png)

- Scrape Reviews 
![reviews-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/reviews-section.png)


#### Output Page ('/output')
![output-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/output-page.png)

The Output page helps you manage your tasks. You can use it to:

- See tasks and their status (pending, in progress, or completed).
- Abort or delete any task.
![abort-delete.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/abort-delete.png)

- Additionally, whenever you run a query, a task named "All Task" will be created for it, which combines results from multiple queries.

For example, if you search for "Web Developers" in "Cupertino, California" and "Redwood City, California", the "All Task" will show you the combined results for both queries.

![all-task.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/all-task.png)

#### Results Page ('/output/1')
![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)

This is the most important page where you can view, sort, filter, or download the results of the task.

**Sorting**

![sort.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort.png)

By default, we sort the listings using "Tech Savvy, High Earners" order, which is as follows:

- Reviews [Businesses with more reviews come first]
- Website [Businesses with websites come first]
- Is Spending On Ads [Businesses already investing in ads are more likely to invest in your product, so they appear at the very top.]

You can also sort by other criteria, such as name or reviews.

![sort-small.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort-small.png)

**Filters**

![filter.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/filter.png)

To find the exact results you're looking for, click the "Show Filters" button and apply the desired filters.

**Export**

![export.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/export.png)

Download results in various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel) using the export button.

### ❓ What are the various search strategies, and which one should I use?

There are 5 kinds of search strategies:
- Fast (Default)
- Fastest
- Detailed
- By Zoom Level (15, 16, 17, 18)
- By Geolocation

![search-strategies.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/search-strategies.png)

Let's see when to use which strategy:

**Fast (Default):**
- Returns 120–1600 results per city.
- Completes in 1–10 minutes per city.
- **When to use:**
  - Best for country-level extraction (completes in 1–2 days).

**Fastest:**
- Slightly faster than Fast mode (~30 seconds per city), but returns ~30–40 fewer results.
- **When to use:**
  - When speed is the top priority and a small reduction in results is acceptable.

**Detailed:**
- Returns more results than Fast mode, but takes significantly longer.
- **When to use:**
  - Best for single-city or state level extraction where thoroughness matters.
- **⚠️ When not to use:**
  - Not recommended for country-level extraction due to high time requirements.
  - Tip: Set "Max Results" to 1000 per city, otherwise large cities like New York can take 2+ hours.

**By Zoom Level (15, 16, 17, 18):**
- Various Zoom Level sizes are given below:
  - Zoom 15: Neighborhood Level
  - Zoom 16: Sub-Neighborhood Level
  - Zoom 17: Block Level (Time consuming)
  - Zoom 18: Street Level (Very time consuming)
- **When to use:**
  - When you want the absolute highest results. Use Zoom 18. It can take 3-4 hours, but you will have thousands of results for big cities like New York City.
- **⚠️ When not to use:**
  - Not recommended for country level extraction. It can take 3-4 hours for a single city.

**By Geolocation:**
- Search a specific latitude/longitude or inside a polygon.
- **When to use:**
  - Getting results that are only in a specific area, but not outside it.


### ❓ How to use the Geolocation feature?

The Geolocation search strategy lets you search for businesses in a specific area of a city. Good for businesses in a specific area, but not outside it.

**Real-World Example: Web Developer Targeting Restaurants**

Suppose you are a web developer, specializing in **making websites** for **restaurants**. Here's a strategy to get customers:

1. **Find restaurants in a specific neighborhood** — e.g., Chinatown, San Francisco.
2. **Study top restaurants** — Identify what successful Chinatown restaurants are doing that drives more customers to them.
3. **Personalize your pitch** — When you contact owners, you can:
   - Highlight specific tactics their nearby competitors are using on their website to attract more customers
   - Suggest improvements based on what's working for their competitors

**Why this works:** Business owners are interested in what their local competitors are doing. This approach helps you come across as knowledgeable about their market.

### ❓ How to create polygons and search using Geolocation?

1. Visit [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/)
2. Search for your desired city or neighborhood (e.g., "San Francisco")
3. Draw the search area using the polygon/circle tool

**Tips:**
- Press **Enter** to save your drawing.
- Left Click on drawing to delete it. 

4. Draw as many shapes as needed to cover your area
5. Copy and paste the GeoJSON from geojson.io into the text area of **Polygons Data**.
6. Press **Run** to start the task.

![geolocation.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/geolocation.gif)

### ❓ I have enough results and want to stop the task. How do I do it?

Click on the Abort Icon to abort the task.

![abort-task.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/abort-task.png)

**Note:**
- Aborting an All Task will abort its child tasks.
- If you close the application while a **child task** is **in progress**:

![sub-task-in-progress.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sub-task-in-progress.png)

That in-progress task will lose all progress and start from 0 when you reopen the app.

### ❓ I want all restaurants (or any category) in the US. What's the best approach?

Use the Country Level Data feature, with default Search Strategy "Fast". 

It can take 2-3 days to complete for countries with tens of thousands of cities, like the US. 

⚠️ **Important:** Don't use Zoom 18 for country-level data—it would take 20-30 days. 

### ❓ I'm an AI research student. I need all coffee shops in San Francisco for my recommendation AI. How can I get this data?

This is the kind of use case our tool was built for—helping students access data for their research projects.

Use the **Zoom 18** search strategy for San Francisco. Let it run overnight. You'll have tens of thousands of results, which is perfect for your research project. There's no cost, as you get **200** free searches each month.


### ❓ What else can I use this tool for?

1. Finding customers for your startup. Very common use case.

2. Hiring Top Talent
   - Example: To hire a good salesperson, search for "Sales Training" in a specific country and contact the training centers for candidate recommendations.
   - Benefits:
     - Much higher quality candidates compared to online job portals
     - Saves a lot of time that would otherwise be spent screening and interviewing a much larger pool of candidates
     - We've done this ourselves as well. 
3. Discovering the Best Service Providers
   - Find top-rated service providers in your area for specific needs.
   - Examples:
      - Search for "Yoga Classes" in your city to find the highest-rated yoga classes for health and long life.
      - Search for "Library" in your city to find the best place to focus on your work.
      - Search for "Restaurant" in your city to find the tastiest food options.
      - Search for "Computer Repair" in your city to find the most reputable and reliable computer repair shops.
      - The list goes on...

This tool can help you save time in various aspects of your personal and professional life.

Just run one search in the tool—it will take only 5 minutes to download and install—and your search for the best Google Maps extractor will end right here. 


### ❓ I'm starting my business. Which cities should I choose to find customers?

The key is to start with customers who:
  - have money, and
  - are willing to spend it on solutions that make their lives easier. 
  
These are the richest cities, tech-hubs in your target country. Choose them because they earn more, so they buy more easily.

We recommend following these steps:

1. First choose your target country.
2. Then choose the richest cities in that country. 
3. Use Zoom 18 Search Strategy for maximum results.
4. Reach out via cold calls or personalized emails—show how your product/service solves their problems.

**Examples:**
- If your chosen country is 
US -> Start with San Francisco, Los Angeles,  New York City.
Australia -> Start with Sydney
Switzerland -> Start with Zurich

**Note:**
Don't start by targeting full country data. You'll have a lower conversion rate and lower revenue per customer.

### ❓ Which country should I choose to find customers?

Your own country, because you're more comfortable talking to people there. 

Once your product is perfected, and is creating good value for your customers, you can start focusing on US, as they tend to be more open to trying new products and services.

<!-- ### ❓ But why do you suggest US?

In this documentation and inside the tool, we specifically use US terms
- US Cities not my own country cities
- Postal Codes/Neighborhoods not terms like (pincode/sector)

But why? Because Americans are our biggest customers. To sell, it's wise to **appeal** to your biggest customers. 

That's why we suggest the US (given your product creates value, customers are paying, and it has global appeal). Plus:

- US businesses are very open to trying new products and services.
- Clear communication and demonstrated value tend to work well in this market. -->

### ❓ What is the Enrichment Section in App?

The Enrichment API turns Google Maps business data into sales-ready contacts.

You've got businesses from Google Maps. Now you need to actually reach them. That's where enrichment comes in:

- **Email Verification & Social Links**
  - Get emails and social profiles from websites. 
  - AI ranks emails for sales outreach (prioritizing emails with higher chance of converting)
  - Verify deliverability before you send.

- **Phone Carrier Info**
  - Know if it's a landline or mobile
  - Get carrier name (Verizon, AT&T, etc.)
  - Essential for calling—don't waste time on landlines

- **Place Sales Summary**
  - AI-generated business context from their Google Maps listing
  - Tailored to YOUR product—tell us what you sell, we tell you how to pitch them
  - Walk into calls knowing exactly what problems you can solve for them

**Bottom line:** Same leads, same sales—but with enrichment, your conversion rate multiplies. That's more customers from the same effort.

[Start enriching for free](https://www.omkar.cloud/tools/business-enrichment)—600 credits/month included.

### ❓ Enough theory. Give me real-world examples of how I can use this tool to find customers.

- **Web Developer** → Search "real estate agency" in "San Francisco", filter **50+ reviews, no website**. Offer "done in 7 days" website for **$1000 + $40/mo hosting**. 

- **Google Ads Agency** → Target Gyms/Yoga Studios with high reviews but no website (successful but technically novice). Offer to run Google Maps Ads to bring 20 new members/month. Gym owners love anything that brings foot traffic.

- **Dental Software** → Find Dentists with 50+ reviews, no website. Visit during non-peak hours, demo your product, and offer 6 months free trial. They'll pay $40-60/month when it saves their receptionist 10+ hrs/week.

### ❓ How to apply this to my product/service?
<!-- 
This is the most important question in this README—and the reason you're here.

Read this carefully. We ourselves have done cold calling and cold emails, and made sales. This isn't theory—it's real-world experience. -->

There are 3 parts to making sales:

<!-- #### 1. Great Desire

Sales require great effort. You'll only put in that effort if you truly want the sale.

If you don't have strong desire, you'll quit after 3-4 rejections. So before you start, think about what closing these deals means for your life and business. Visualize your success colorfully. 
 -->
#### 1. Learn First

Going into sales without learning is like going to battle with sticks. You won't survive.

Read sales books—they'll save you time and help you avoid common mistakes. For cold outreach specifically, read **"The Cold Email Manifesto"**. It's practical, and it works. 

#### 2. Make a Strategy

**Filter your leads** — Only contact businesses most likely to buy:
- Reviews: 75-200 (established, but small enough to care)
- Rating: 4+ stars (you're the **best of the best**—obviously you'll only talk to the best)

**Use Enrichment** — Enrich your data to save research time and increase your conversion rate:
- Social Links & Emails → Get the emails for sales outreach
- Email Verification → Ensure deliverability
- Place Sales Summary → Personalize your pitch
- Phone Carrier Info → Know if it's a landline or mobile

**Sort by reviews** — Bigger businesses first. They pay more.

**Mark your best leads** — In Excel, highlight businesses most likely to benefit from your service with a green background. 

**For Cold Calling:**
- Read **"The Cold Email Manifesto"** first—it applies to calls too
- Use Phone Carrier Info Enrichment to skip landlines
- Call during industry non-peak hours to reach owners directly
- Use Place Sales Summary to personalize your pitch
- Get a dedicated phone number, protects your personal number

**For Cold Emailing:**
- Use AI-Recommended Emails + Email Verification Enrichment
- Use Place Sales Summary to personalize each email
- PERSONALIZE! PERSONALIZE! PERSONALIZE! (takes 15-20 minutes per email, but converts way better)

**We recommend cold calling over cold email, here's why:**
- **Simpler** — Just pick up the phone. No complex email sequences.
- **Faster feedback, faster improvement** — Rejections tell you exactly what to fix for the next call.
- **Less competition** — Most people do cold email. Fewer calls = more attention = higher close rate.
<!-- - **Potentially higher conversion** — Cold calling often provides faster feedback. Cold email involves more variables and may take longer to see results. -->

If you're new to sales, start with cold calling—it's simpler, faster, and converts better than email. As a bonus, you'll learn faster due to instant feedback.

You're an introvert, and calling feels scary. You're right—it is scary. People will hang up on you and rudely reject you.

But think about it: you've done harder things before. Haven't you?

Compared to those, calling is a piece of cake. People way less smart than you have closed deals. You'll totally crush it.

Try it for 2-3 days—if it doesn't work, you can always switch to email.

#### 3. Execute

Most founders quit after 3-4 rejections. You should not. 

If someone rejects you, they are unwise and making a mistake. It's their fault, not yours.

And you're a diamond 😎. Only Jewelers recognize diamonds, not blacksmiths. 

So, keep going. Also, in worst cases, expect 40-50 connected calls (~2-4 days of calling) to close 1 deal. That's normal.

This is the most important FAQ, so be sure to read it again and put it into practice.

### ❓ How Did You Build This Extractor?

We used Botasaurus Desktop, which powers the Google Maps Extractor.

Botasaurus is a web scraping framework that makes life a lot easier for web scrapers.

It handled the hardest parts of our extractor, such as:

- Building a desktop app for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Creating a fantastic UI dashboard with task management features.
- Sorting, filtering, and exporting data as CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.
- Caching, parallel, and asynchronous scraping.

If you're a web scraper, I really recommend learning about Botasaurus Desktop [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/botasaurus/blob/master/botasaurus-desktop-tutorial.md) 🚀.

Learning Botasaurus Desktop takes about 25 minutes. If you do web scraping, it can save you thousands of hours over your career.

### ❓ While a task is in progress, "All Task" shows around 80K results, but after completion it drops to 70K. Why?

We remove duplicates at the end of all tasks, so expect the final count to be lower than what you see during progress. 

Google lists the same places across multiple cities, so expect results to drop by 20% to 40% for country-level extraction.



### ❓ In the exported file, the characters are in English instead of Japanese/Korean/Hindi. How can I preserve the original language when exporting?

When exporting, any non-English characters are converted to English. For example, "しんちゃん" is converted to "Shinchan."

We do this because Excel can't render non-English characters properly.

If you want to retain the original characters and avoid converting them to English, simply **uncheck** the English conversion checkbox:

![Uncheck English](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/uncheck-english.png)

In case you are unable to view the non-English characters properly in Excel, then the easiest solution is to upload the file to Google Sheets, which renders the characters properly.

### ❓ Do I Need to Do Anything Else to Use the Tool Effectively?

1. Disable Auto Sleep Mode
  Auto sleep mode will prevent the tool from running and cause tasks to fail. Here's how to turn it off:

  - **On Windows**:
      Go to **Start** > **Settings** > **System** > **Power & battery** > **System** > **Screen & Sleep**. Set the following settings to "Never"  
      ![windows-sleep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/windows-sleep.png)

  - **On Mac**:
      Open **Settings** > **Lock Screen**, then set the following settings to "Never."  
      ![mac-sleep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/mac-sleep.png)
  - **Linux?**:  
     You're awesome at computers, so go ahead and figure it out! ;)

2. Ensure you maintain a stable Internet connection, as switching connections will cause currently running tasks to fail.

### ❓ On macOS, Google Chrome is not opening when I run the app. What should I do?

This is a known macOS-specific issue. We expect to resolve it by December 2026. As a workaround, **close this app** and Chrome will open normally.
