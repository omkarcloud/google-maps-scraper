## ⚡ Enlightening Questions

### ❓ How to Get Results for My Queries?

1. Enter your search queries.

![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

2. Now, simply press the Run button.

![Run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/run.png)

3. Get the results in 2 minutes, woo hoo! 🎉

![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)


### ❓ What are the different pages and how do they help me?

Mainly, there are 3 pages in the UI Dashboard:

- Home Page ('/')
- Output Page ('/output')
- Results Page ('/output/1')

#### Home Page ('/')

![Homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/homepage.png)

You can input your queries here and search by:
- List of queries
![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

- List of links
![links-queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/links-queries.png)

- Scrape data for a specific type of business across all cities in a country.
![country-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/country-section.png)

- Scrape Reviews 
![reviews-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/reviews-section.png)


#### Output Page ('/output')
![output-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/output-page.png)

The Output page helps you manage your tasks. You can use it to:

- See tasks and their status (pending, in progress, or completed).
- Abort or delete any task.
![abort-delete.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/abort-delete.png)

- Additionally, whenever you run a query, a task named "All Task" will be created for it, which combines results from multiple queries.

For example, if you search for "Web Developers" in "Cupertino, California" and "Redwood City, California", the "All Task" will show you the combined results for both queries.

![all-task.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/all-task.png)

#### Results Page ('/output/1')
![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)

This is the most important page where you can view, sort, filter, or download the results of the task.

**Sorting**

![sort.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort.png)

By default, we sort the listings using "Tech Savvy, High Earners" order, which is as follows:

- Reviews [Businesses with more reviews come first]
- Website [Businesses with websites come first]
- Is Spending On Ads [Businesses already investing in ads are more likely to invest in your product, so they appear at the very top.]

You can also sort by other criteria, such as name or reviews.

![sort-small.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort-small.png)

**Filters**

![filter.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/filter.png)

To find the exact results you're looking for, click the "Show Filters" button and apply the desired filters.

**Export**

![export.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/export.png)

Download results in various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel) using the export button.

### ❓ What are various search strategies, which one to use?

There are 4 kinds of search strategies:
- Fast
- Detailed (Default)
- By Zoom Level (15, 16, 17, 18)
- By Geolocation

![search-strategies.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/search-strategies.png)

Let's see when to use which strategy:

**Fast:**
- Get results in 1 minute, usually 120+ results/city.
- **When to use:**
  - You need to get full country results in 1-2 days.

**Detailed (Default):**
- Get results in 7-8 days, usually 250+ results/city. But can also go into tens of thousands of results/city.
- Nice combination of speed and high results.
- **When to use:**
  - You need to get full country results, and have 1-2 weeks of time.
  - We recommend setting "Max Results" per city to 1000. Else, it can spend 2+ hours for large cities like New York City.

**By Zoom Level (15, 16, 17, 18):**
- Various Zoom Level sizes are given below:
  - Zoom 15: Neighborhood Level
  - Zoom 16: Sub-Neighborhood Level
  - Zoom 17: Block Level (Time consuming)
  - Zoom 18: Street Level (Very time consuming)
- **When to use:**
  - When you want the absolute highest results. Use Zoom 18. It can take 3-4 hours, but you will have tens of thousands of results for big cities like New York City.
- **⚠️ When not to use:**
  - Not recommended for country level extraction. It can take 3-4 hours for a single city.

**By Geolocation:**
- Search a specific latitude/longitude or inside a polygon.
- **When to use:**
  - Getting results that are only in a specific area, but not outside it.


### ❓ How to use the Geolocation feature?

The Geolocation search strategy lets you search for businesses in a specific area of a city. Good for businesses in a specific area, but not outside it.

**Real-World Example: Web Developer Targeting Restaurants**

Suppose you are a web developer, specializing in **making websites** for **restaurants**. Here's a strategy to improve your conversion rate:

1. **Find restaurants in a specific neighborhood** — e.g., Chinatown, San Francisco.
2. **Study top restaurants** — Identify what successful Chinatown restaurants are doing that drives more customers to them.
3. **Personalize your pitch** — When you contact owners, you can:
   - Highlight specific tactics their nearby competitors are using on their website to attract more customers
   - Suggest improvements based on what's working for their competitors

**Why this works:** Owners are all ears 👂🏼 when you talk about their local competitors. This approach quickly gains their attention, and you come across as a knowledgeable expert, leading to a higher conversion rate.

### ❓ How to create polygons and search using Geolocation?

1. Visit [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/)
2. Search for your desired city or neighborhood (e.g., "San Francisco")
3. Draw the search area using the polygon/circle tool

**Tips:**
- Press **Enter** to save your drawing.
- Left Click on drawing to delete it. 

4. Draw as many shapes as needed to cover your area
5. Copy and paste the GeoJSON from geojson.io into the text area of **Polygons Data**.
6. Press **Run** to start the task.

![geolocation.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/geolocation.gif)

### ❓ I have got enough results, and want to stop the Task. How to do it?

Click on the Abort Icon to abort the task.

![abort-task.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/abort-task.png)

**Note:**
- Aborting an All Task will abort its subtasks.
- If you close the application while a **sub task** is **in progress**.

![sub-task-in-progress.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sub-task-in-progress.png)

That in-progress task will lose all progress and start from 0 when you reopen the app.

### ❓ What else can I use this tool for?

1. Finding customers for your startup. Very common use case.

2. Hiring Top Talent
   - Example: To hire a good salesperson, search for "Sales Training" in a specific country and contact the training centers for candidate recommendations.
   - Benefits:
     - Much higher quality candidates compared to online job portals
     - Saves a lot of time that would otherwise be spent screening and interviewing a much larger pool of candidates
     - We have done this for ourselves as well. 
3. Discovering the Best Service Providers
   - Find top-rated service providers in your area for specific needs.
   - Examples:
      - Search for "Yoga Classes" in your city to find the highest-rated yoga classes for health and long life.
      - Search for "Library" in your city to find the best place to focus on your work.
      - Search for "Restaurant" in your city to find the tastiest food options.
      - Search for "Computer Repair" in your city to find the most reputable and reliable computer repair shops.
      - The list goes on...

This tool can save you time and money in various aspects of your personal and professional life :)


### ❓ I want all restaurants (or any category) in the US. What's the best approach?

Use the Country Level Data feature, with Search Strategy "Fast". 

It can take 2-3 days to complete for countries with tens of thousands of cities, like the US. 


### ❓ I'm an AI Research Student. I need all coffee shops in San Francisco for my Recommendation AI. How can I get this data?

This is exactly the kind of use case our tool was built for—helping students access data for their research without breaking the bank.

Use Search Strategy with **Zoom 18** for San Francisco. Let it run overnight. You'll have tens of thousands of results, which is perfect for your research project. Cost will be 0, as you get 200 searches free each month.

### ❓ While in progress, "All Task" shows around 80K results, but after completion it drops to 40K. Why?

We remove duplicates at the end of all tasks, so expect the final count to be lower than what you see during progress. 

Google lists the same places across multiple cities, so expect results to drop by 50% to 80% for country-level extraction.

### ❓ Are there any usage limits?

The free version only allows 200 searches per month. To get unlimited searches for a lifetime, consider upgrading to the Pro Version:
- The Pro Version gives you access to unlimited searches for a lifetime. Say a Big-Big NO to websites selling expensive plans.

- Only a one-time investment with lifetime updates and top-notch WhatsApp support, all for just $28.
- Best of all? Absolutely zero risk, as we offer a generous 90-day, no-questions-asked refund guarantee.

[1000+ Happy People](https://github.com/sponsors/omkarcloud?frequency=one-time) have already invested in the Pro Version and are reaping its benefits to grow their businesses.

### ❓ What if I Don't Get Value from It?

We wholeheartedly ❤️ believe in the value our product brings for you, especially since it has successfully worked for hundreds of people like you.
 
But, we also understand the reservations you might have.

That's why we've put the ball in your court: **If, within the next 90 days, you feel that our product hasn't met your expectations, simply get a refund in 2 clicks only.**

The risk is fully on us, as it should be, because we're confident in what we've created!

### ❓ How Do I Get a Refund?

Your satisfaction is **most important**. We will gladly issue a refund if you are not happy with our product.

Requesting a refund is a **simple two-click process**:

1. Go to the [Transactions Page](https://www.omkar.cloud/billing/transaction-history).
![Transactions Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/transactions-page.png)

2. Click the **Request Refund** button.
![Request Refund Button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/request-refund-button.png)

3. Confirm by clicking **Request Refund** again.
![Confirm Refund Request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/confirm-refund-request.png)

✅ That's it! You'll receive a confirmation email from PayPal, and your money will be returned to your original payment method within **1–2 business days**.


### ❓ Why do you offer a 2-click, 90-day refund policy? Is there any catch?

**No catch.** To date, we have refunded every single customer who asked for a refund. It will be the same for you. Last year we refunded 100+ customers. No questions asked.

**Why we do this:**

- It's Good Karma. Good Karma comes back to you here or hereafter, many times over.
- Plus, giving easy refunds takes the risk equation out of purchase, so more people buy. It's a win-win situation for both of us. 
- Many great creators like John Sonmez also do this, and we like to follow their example.


### ❓ I'm starting my business. Which cities should I choose to find customers?

The key thing is to start with customers who 
  - have money 
  - and are willing to spend it on solutions that make their lives easier. 
  
These are the richest urban cities, tech-hubs in your target country, because they earn more, so they spend more.

We recommend following these steps:

1. First choose your target country.
2. Then choose the richest cities in that country. 
3. Use Zoom 18 Search Strategy for maximum results, for the chosen cities.
4. Use cold calling or send personalized emails to the businesses, showing them how your product/service can make their life easier. 

**Examples:**
- If your chosen country is 
US -> Start with San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles.
Australia -> Start with Sydney
Switzerland -> Start with Zurich

**Note:**
Don't start targeting full country data. You will have a bad conversion rate and lower Revenue Per Customer.

### ❓ Which country should I choose to find customers?

Your own country, because you are more comfortable talking to customers in your own country. 

Once your product is perfected, and is creating good value for your customers, you can start focusing on US customers.

### ❓ But why do you suggest US?

In this documentation and inside the tool, we specifically use US terms
- US Cities not my own country cities
- Postal Codes/Neighborhoods not terms like (pincode/sector)

But why? Because Americans are our biggest customers. To sell, it's wise to **appeal** to your major buyers. 

That's why we suggest the US (given your product creates value, customers **are paying**, and it has global appeal):

- Americans communicate in a straightforward manner — easy to do business with.
- They buy easily, even from overseas sellers, if you show how your product/service makes their work easier or grows their business. At least 3x easier than selling to Asians, who tend to take their time before buying.

Lastly, just start with action. Don't sit around doing analysis-paralysis.

Brace yourself for lots of **rejection**. Keep putting in hours for at least 30-60 days. You should see paying customers if your product/service creates real value. 


### ❓ Can you tell me about the Done For You service?

If you need full country data—say all "Restaurants in US"—running using "Detailed" Search Strategy (Default) can take 1-2 weeks on your system.

With our **Done For You service**, we run it on our servers and deliver the data in 1 day. Huge time savings!

**Pricing:**
- Around $60 for a single category in the USA (typically 300K+ unique results)
- **$250 off** on your first purchase of $250+. So if your project costs $300, you only pay $50!

**Why choose us and not other providers?**
- Low prices as we want long-term relationships.
- Same 90-day unconditional refund guarantee—you take zero risk. As it should be.

Mail us at [happy.to.help@omkar.cloud](mailto:happy.to.help@omkar.cloud) about the data you need, and we will get it done for you. 


### ❓ Do you do custom big data projects?

Yes, we do **big data projects** for businesses at high quality and affordable prices. But why choose us and not other providers?

- The single most important reason is that we do data every day and are experts in it. This product is proof of it.
- 90-day unconditional refund guarantee. So you take 0 risk. 
- Your project will be well done, affordably, simply because we want long-term relationships. And giving great results is the best way to do that.

You can mail us [here](mailto:happy.to.help@omkar.cloud?subject=Big%20Data%20Project%20Request&body=I%20need%20a%20big%20data%20project%20done%20at%20high%20quality%20and%20affordable%20prices.), to enquire about your project.


### ❓ How can I get results via API?

If you are a developer and need to get results programmatically, we offer a dedicated **[Google Maps Extractor API](https://www.omkar.cloud/tools/google-maps-extractor-api)**. It's perfect for integrating Google Maps data directly into your applications or running automated jobs on virtual machines.

The API includes all the features of our pro desktop app, including Unlimited searches and Unlimited devices, plus additional benefits:
- REST API interface 
- Detailed documentation for Google Cloud VM installation

The API is available for $16/month, and you can try it free at [Google Maps Extractor API](https://www.omkar.cloud/tools/google-maps-extractor-api).

### ❓ This Extractor is Truly One-of-a-Kind, Something I've Never Seen Before. How Did You Build It?

Thank you! We used Botasaurus Desktop, which is the secret behind our awesome Google Maps Extractor.

Botasaurus is a web scraping framework that makes life a lot easier for web scrapers.

It handled the hardest parts of our extractor, such as:

- Building a desktop app for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Creating a fantastic UI dashboard with task management features.
- Sorting, filtering, and exporting data as CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.
- Caching, parallel, and asynchronous scraping.

If you're a web scraper, I really recommend learning about Botasaurus Desktop [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/botasaurus/blob/master/botasaurus-desktop-tutorial.md) 🚀.

Trust me, learning Botasaurus Desktop will only take 5 minutes, but I guarantee it will save you thousands of hours in your life as a web scraper.

### ❓ In the exported file, the characters are in English instead of Japanese/Korean/Hindi. How can I preserve the original language when exporting?

When exporting, any non-English characters are converted to English. For example, "しんちゃん" is converted to "Shinchan."

We do this because Excel can't render non-English characters properly.

If you want to retain the original characters and avoid converting them to English, simply **uncheck** the English conversion checkbox:

![Uncheck English](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/uncheck-english.png)

Also, in case you are unable to view the non-English characters properly in Excel, then the easiest solution is to upload the file to Google Sheets, which should render the characters properly.

![character fix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/character-fix.gif)

### ❓ Do I Need to Do Anything Else to Use the Tool Effectively?

1. Disable Auto Sleep Mode
  Auto sleep mode will prevent the tool from running and cause tasks to fail. Here's how to turn it off:

  - **On Windows**:
      Go to **Start** > **Settings** > **System** > **Power & battery** > **System** > **Screen & Sleep**. Set the following settings to "Never"  
      ![windows-sleep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/windows-sleep.png)

  - **On Mac**:
      Open **Settings** > **Lock Screen**, then set the following settings to "Never."  
      ![mac-sleep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/mac-sleep.png)
  - **Linux?**:
