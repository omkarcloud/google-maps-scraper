## ⚡ Enlightening Questions

### ❓ How to Get Results for My Queries?

1. Enter your search queries or Google Maps place/search link.

![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

2. Now, simply press the Run button.

![Run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/run.png)

3. Get the results in 2 minutes, woo hoo! 🎉

![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)


### ❓ What are the different pages and how do they help me?

Mainly, there are 3 pages in the UI Dashboard:

- Home Page ('/')
- Output Page ('/output')
- Results Page ('/output/1')

#### Home Page ('/')

![Homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/homepage.png)

You can input your queries here and search by:
- List of queries
![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

- List of links
![links-queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/links-queries.png)

- Scrape data for a specific type of business across all cities in a country.
![country-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/country-section.png)

- Scrape Reviews 
![reviews-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/reviews-section.png)

Please note that you are guaranteed to receive at least **240 reviews** per place. However, in some cases, due to technical limitations, the complete set of reviews may not be available.

#### Output Page ('/output')
![output-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/output-page.png)

The Output page helps you manage your tasks. You can use it to:

- See tasks and their status (pending, in progress, or completed).
- Abort or delete any task.
![abort-delete.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/abort-delete.png)

- Additionally, whenever you run a query, a task named "All Task" will be created for it, which combines results from multiple queries.

For example, if you search for "Web Developers in Bangalore" and "Web Developers in Mumbai", the "All Task" will show you the combined results for both queries.

![all-task.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/all-task.png)

#### Results Page ('/output/1')
![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)

This is the most important page where you can view, sort, filter, or download the results of the task.

**Sorting**

![sort.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort.png)

By default, we sort the listings using a really good sorting order, which is as follows ("Best Potential Customers"):

- Reviews [Businesses with more reviews come first]
- Website [Businesses more open to technology come first]
- Is Spending On Ads [Businesses already investing in ads are more likely to invest in your product, so they appear first.]

You can also sort by other criteria, such as name or reviews.

![sort-small.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort-small.png)

**Filters**

![filter.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/filter.png)

To find the exact results you're looking for, click the "Show Filters" button and apply the desired filters.

**Export**

![export.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/export.png)

Download results in various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel) using the export button.


### ❓ How many search results can I get in a single query?

Google Maps gives at most 120 results per search query. Don't worry about running out of data, as you can always use country-level scraping to scrape thousands of cities.


### ❓ Are there any usage limits?

      ![windows-sleep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/windows-sleep.png)

  - **On Mac**:
      Open **Settings** > **Lock Screen**, then set the following settings to "Never."  
      ![mac-sleep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/mac-sleep.png)
  - **Linux?**:  
     You're awesome at computers, so go ahead and figure it out! ;)

### ❓ This Extractor is Truly One-of-a-Kind, Something I've Never Seen Before. How Did You Build It?

Thank you! We used Botasaurus Desktop, which is the secret behind our awesome Google Maps Extractor.

Botasaurus is a web scraping framework that makes life a lot easier for web scrapers.

It handled the hardest parts of our extractor, such as:

- Building a desktop app for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Creating a fantastic UI dashboard with task management features.
- Sorting, filtering, and exporting data as CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.
- Caching, parallel, and asynchronous scraping.

If you're a web scraper, I really recommend learning about Botasaurus Desktop [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/botasaurus/blob/master/botasaurus-desktop-tutorial.md) 🚀.

Trust me, learning Botasaurus Desktop will only take 5 minutes, but I guarantee it will definitely save you thousands of hours in your life as a web scraper.

  </a>
</p>


### ❓ How can I get results via API?

If you are a developer and need to get results programmatically, we offer a dedicated **[Google Maps Extractor API](https://www.omkar.cloud/tools/google-maps-extractor-api)**. It's perfect for integrating Google Maps data directly into your applications or running automated jobs on virtual machines.

The API includes all the features of our pro desktop app, including Unlimited searches and Unlimited devices, plus additional benefits:
- REST API interface 
- Detailed documentation for Google Cloud VM installation

The API is available for $16/month, and you can try it free at [Google Maps Extractor API](https://www.omkar.cloud/tools/google-maps-extractor-api).

### ❓ In the exported file, the characters are in English instead of Japanese/Korean/Hindi. How can I preserve the original language when exporting?

When exporting, any non-English characters are converted to English. For example, "しんちゃん" is converted to "Shinchan"

We do this because Excel can't render non-English characters properly.

If you want to retain the original characters and avoid converting them to English, simply **uncheck** the English conversion checkbox:

![Uncheck English](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/uncheck-english.png)

Also, in case you are unable to view the non-English characters properly in Excel, then the easiest solution is to upload the file to Google Sheets, which should render the characters properly.
