## ⚡ Enlightening Questions

### ❓ How to Get Results for My Queries?

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enter your search queries.

![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

2. Now, simply press the Run button.

![Run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/run.png)

### ❓ What are the different pages and how do they help me?

Primarily, there are 3 pages in the UI Dashboard:

- Home Page ('/')
- Output Page ('/output')
- Results Page ('/output/1')

#### Home Page ('/')

![Homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/homepage.png)

You can input your queries here and search by:
- List of queries
![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

- List of links
![links-queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/links-queries.png)

- Scrape data for a specific type of business across all cities in a country.
![country-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/country-section.png)

- Scrape Reviews
![reviews-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/reviews-section.png)

Kindly note that due to privacy concerns, we do not scrape personally identifiable information of reviewers, such as names, and profile photos. We only scrape the review text, rating, owner response, and similar non-personally identifiable information.

#### Output Page ('/output')
![output-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/output-page.png)

The Output page helps you manage your tasks. You can use it to:

- See tasks and their status (pending, in progress, or completed).
- Abort or delete any task.
![abort-delete.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/abort-delete.png)

- Additionally, Whenever you run a query, a task named "All Task" will be created for it, which combines results from multiple queries.

For example, if you search for "Web Developers in Bangalore" and "Web Developers in Mumbai", the "All Task" will show you the combined results for both queries.

![all-task.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/all-task.png)

#### Results Page ('/output/1')
![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)

This is the most important page where you can view, sort, filter, or download the results of the task.

**Sorting**

![sort.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort.png)

By default, we sort the listings using a really good sorting order, which is as follows ("Best Potential Customers"):

- Reviews [Businesses with more reviews come first]
- Website [Businesses more open to technology come first]
- Is Spending On Ads [Businesses already investing in ads are more likely to invest in your product, so they appear first.]

You can also sort by other criteria, such as name or reviews.

![sort-small.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort-small.png)

**Filters**

![filter.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/filter.png)

To find the exact results you're looking for, click the "Show Filters" button and apply the desired filters.

**Export**

![export.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/export.png)

Download results in various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel) using the export button.


#### Api Page ('/api-integration')

![api-integration-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/api-integration-page.png)

The API Page provides documentation on integration of the Google Maps Scraper into your application via a REST API, for running tasks, getting results, and managing tasks.

### ❓ How many search results can I get in a single query?

Google Maps give at most 120 results per search query. Don't worry about running out of data, as you can always use country-level scraping to scrape thousands of cities.


### ❓ How can I access additional information like websites, phone numbers, geo-coordinates, and price ranges?


Free versions shows only a limited set of data points. To access additional data points, consider upgrading to the Pro Version:

### ❓ How can I get Email, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. of the places?

While our Google Maps Scraper provides unlimited places with 40+ data points, you may optionally want to use our Website Contact Scraper Addon to get LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and other contact information for the results. 

These details help you reach out to business owners more effectively.

The data quality is excellent. Kindly follow these steps to use the Website Contact Scraper Addon:

1. Sign up on RapidAPI by visiting [this link](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up).

![Sign Up on RapidAPI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/assets/master/images/sign-up.png)

2. Subscribe to the Free Plan by visiting [this link](https://rapidapi.com/Chetan11dev/api/website-social-scraper-api/pricing).

![Subscribe to Free Plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/subscribe.png)

3. Copy the API key.
![Copy the API Key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/key.png)

Now you have two options for using the Website Contact Scraper Addon:

#### Option 1: Get contacts for all places in a search query

Enter the copied API key in the "Email and Social Links Extraction" section and run it:

![social-section.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/social-section.png)

#### Option 2: Get contacts for specific chosen websites (saves money)

1. Click the Website Contact Scraper button:
![website-contacts-scraper-button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/website-contacts-scraper-button.png)

2. Enter the specific websites you're interested in, the copied API key and run it:
![interested-websites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/interested-websites.png)

3. After this, you'll have the contact details for the chosen websites.

![contacts-websites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/contacts-websites.png)

### ❓ How much does the Website Contact Scraper Addon cost?

There are 3 plans available:
- Free Plan: 200 places free every month
- $6/1000 Contacts Plan: 1000 places for $6
- $33/10000 Contacts Plan: 10000 places for just $3.33 per 1000

For most users, the Free Plan is sufficient. You can selectively choose the websites you're interested in and use the Website Contacts Scraper to get details for only those chosen websites.

![website-contacts-scraper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/website-contacts-scraper.png)

Although, If you need thousands of contacts, consider the $6/1000 Contacts Plan or $33/10000 Contacts Plan.

The data quality is excellent, and the cost is very reasonable. Considering that landing just one customer from 1000 contacts can easily cover your investment and generate a nice profit.

### ❓ This Scraper is Truly One-of-a-Kind, Something I've Never Seen Before. How Did You Build It?

Thank you! We used Botasaurus, which is the secret behind our awesome Google Maps Scraper.

Botasaurus is a web scraping framework that makes life a lot easier for web scrapers.

It handled the hardest parts of our scraper, such as:

- Creating a mastastic UI dashboard with task management features
- Sorting, filtering, and exporting data as CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.
- Caching, parallel and asynchronous scraping
- Built-in integration with Kubernetes, Docker, Server, Gitpod, and a REST API

If you're a web scraper, I really recommend learning about Botasaurus [here](https://www.omkar.cloud/l/google-maps-to-botasaurus/) 🚀.

Trust me, learning Botasaurus will only take 20 minutes, but I guarantee it will definitely save you thousands of hours in your life as a web scraper.
