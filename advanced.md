## 🤔 Advanced Questions

### ❓ I don't have Python, or I'm facing errors when setting up the scraper on my PC. How to solve it?

You can easily run the scraper in Gitpod, a browser-based development environment. Set it up in just 5 minutes by following these steps:

1. Visit [this link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper) and sign up using your GitHub account.

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
4. You will see a popup notification with the heading "A service is available on port 3000". In the popup notification, press the **"Open Browser"** button to open the UI Dashboard in your browser

Note, that it's important to regularly interact with the Gitpod environment, such as clicking within it every 30 minutes, to keep the machine active and prevent automatic shutdown. 

If you don't want to click every 30 minutes, then we encourage you to install Python and Node.js on your PC and run it locally. 

### ❓ Do I Need Proxies?

No, you do not need to use proxies, you're free to run as many queries as you like.
